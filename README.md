# Longitudinal Modeling
While studying statistical methods for longitudinal modeling, I came across the book ["Longitudinal Analysis"](https://www.routledge.com/Longitudinal-Analysis-Modeling-Within-Person-Fluctuation-and-Change/Hoffman/p/book/9780415876025) by Lesa Hoffman. 
The book provides several examples of methods for longitudinal analysis: unfortunately, the examples provided are in SPSS, SAS, STATA, and Mplus, with a porting of the examples to the R programming language available [here](https://github.com/andkov/psy564). 
As I always use Python for my analysis, I decided to re-write all the examples in Python. In this repository, you will find all the examples from the book written in Python using [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) as a library for the statistical analyis.

## Organization
You will find all the examples of the books in subfolders, one for each chapter.
